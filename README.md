# Green Directory

Structured data repository of Green Party organisations

## Goals

- Enable applications in need of structured data regarding
  Green party organizations

- Provide high quality, well maintained structured data

- Allow for an open and transparent data maintenance workflow
  based on Github pull requests.

## Help Wanted

This project needs help with:

- Structured data imports: As soon as a schema is defined initially,
  we need help with importing data. Pull requests welcome!

Please also look at the [issues](https://github.com/netzbegruenung/green-directory/issues)
for anything tagged with `help wanted`.

When in doubt, please file an issue to ask a question or report
a feature wish.

## Data Structure

- YAML is used as a source format.

- We try to avoid as much extra markup as possible (quotes, brackets)

- We have a folder structure that helps humans to find relevant files,
  but which should not be read in a semantical fashion. The folder hierarchy
  can vary from country to country and from locality to locality.
  Likewise, data file names have no meaning.

- YAML files have the ending `.yaml`.

- All data files are lists of entries (starting with a `---` line). Every file ends with a new line character.

- The schema definition (attributes and permitted values) depends on the
  type of entry. See below for details.
